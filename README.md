## This is the Crossword Squad Webpage

Our utilities are meant to aid in solving daily newspaper puzzles, specifically the crossword and jumble. The user can input a sequence of letters for either the jumble solver or the crossword solver and the application will return a list of possible solutions. When inputting for the crossword solver, the user must use '?' to indicate unknown letters. 


Our application uses the Linux words file and user input to return clues to the user. The solvers are built with Python3 and displayed through a GUI created with PySimpleGUI.  

How To:
=======
1. download .zip file `solver.zip`
2. unzip folder
3. run `python3 ./main.py`

Use:
====
- Jumble: type letters of the jumble and press `unJumble`
- Crossword: type clues in the form `???LO` and press `Crossword` to see list of possible words
