## This is the Crossword Squad Webpage

After having spent months doing nothing but the crossword and jumble in all of our classes, we thought it fitting to create tools to aid us in our goal of never paying attention in class.


Our utilities are meant to aid in solving daily newspaper puzzles, specifically the crossword and jumble. The user can input a sequence of letters for either the jumble solver or the crossword solver and the application will return a list of possible solutions. When inputting for the crossword solver, the user must use '?' to indicate unknown letters. 


Our application uses the Linux words file and user input to return clues to the user. The solvers are built with Python3 and displayed through a GUI created with PySimpleGUI. Further utilities within the application should be built around the **Words** class which imports the words file and organizes it by length.
